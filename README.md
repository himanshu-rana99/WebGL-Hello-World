This is an introduction to WebGL program to learn the basics as part of my Interactive Computer Graphics course I took. I was able to learn how to o define
geometry and colors, send data to the GPU, and adjust vertex and shader parameters to change the appearance of an object. The two main files are a JavaScript file which defines the shape objects and an HTML file that contains the vertex shader used to create the colors. 

Here are some of the shapes I made:
